# pt6964
A display based on the PT6968 segment controller get a new life! muahahah! 
Salvaged display with keys from a old sat receiver. Connected it to attin2313 and wrote this little code to give the display a new purpose.
Maybe someone is also finding a pt6964 based display module or similar and try to give it new life :-)
# adapt
You can change the pins in the pt6964.h file if your using another hardware.

# caution
The connection of the segments are not as descripted in the pt6964 datasheet. I think the designers uses other connection to the 7 segment display and LEDs to get a better layout (single layer PCB)
